{"name":"Mozzi","body":"Currently your Arduino can only beep like a microwave oven. Mozzi brings your Arduino to life by allowing it to produce much more complex and interesting gurgles, sweeps and phasing distortions. These sounds can be quickly and easily constructed from familiar synthesis units like oscillators, delays, filters and envelopes.\r\n\r\n[Listen to some example recordings.](https://github.com/sensorium/Mozzi/tree/master/examples_recordings/)\r\n\r\nMozzi is designed to be easy to use, open source and extendable.\r\n\r\nYou can use Mozzi to generate algorithmic music for an installation or performance, or make interactive sonifications of sensors, on a small, modular and super cheap Arduino, without the need for additional shields, message passing or external synths.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy using Mozzi for a project, or have extended it, we would be pleased to hear about it and provide support wherever possible. Contribute suggestions, improvements and bug fixes to the Mozzi forum on Github, or Fork it to contribute directly to future developments.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- \t16384 Hz, 8-bit audio output.  (Actually, nearly 9 bit resolution, -244 to 243).\r\n- \tVariable control rate from 64 Hz upwards.\r\n- \tUseful basic audio toolkit: oscillators, samples, lines, envelopes, scheduling, filtering.\r\n-\tFast ADC and other cpu-efficient code utilities to help keep audio running smoothly.\r\n-\tExample sketches for easy modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nPut Mozzi into your libraries folder.  Restart Arduino so it can find Mozzi.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick Start\r\nTo hear Mozzi, connect a 3.5mm audio jack with the centre wire to the PWM output on Digital pin 9 on Arduino, and the black ground to the Ground on the Arduino.\r\nTry some examples.  They are in your File>Examples>Mozzi menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Hints and Tips\r\nA computer line-in works well for listening, and you can record and examine your\r\nsounds with Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) and\r\nBaudline signal analyser (http://www.baudline.com/).\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n- \tThis code has been tested on Arduino Dumemilanove ATmega328.\r\n- \tMozzi doesn't play nice with Arduino time functions millis(), micros(), delay(), delayMicroseconds().  Instead, you can use Mozzi's TimeBomb() for scheduling.  See the Timebomb() example.\r\n\r\nFeedback about performance on other Arduinos welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Contributions / Included Dependencies\r\nMozzi makes use of the following code:\r\nUnder GPL3:\r\nTimerOne library - See Google Code project http://code.google.com/p/arduino-timerone/ for latest\r\nTimerTwo library - Downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/johnmccombs, 4/2/2012, but unable to find original author.
